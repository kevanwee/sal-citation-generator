# SAL Style Guide Citation Generator
(work in progress) Legal writing is tedious, but forgetting to do your citations and having to figure out what goes where at the end makes it a million times more painful. 

While other citation formats like apa are extensively documented, the SAL Style Guide may be slightly overwhelming on the face of it.

## Where we are at now
<div align="center"><img src="./readme/test.png"></div>

- currently only takes eliti links and requires manual input for case names
- ibid, id, supra references (note: currently broken for manual citations)

## Roadmap
- will be integrating webscrapers to try and automate field inputs.
